#Project's setting

We were challenged in our 4th week of bootcamp (<Academia de Código_>) to build a game in 7 days (nights, actually,
as we still had classes during the day).

# Who are we?

We are a group of strangers made friends during this bootcamp, that really complement each other.
Never have we ever had such a great experience while working in a group before, and soon clicked. We've been good friends since,
and plan on working together again in the future.

André Santos:
The 'debugger'. Already had a bit of background in Java (and programming in general), which helped make this game possible (not only, but also :) )
Loves challenges and puzzles, is always up to learn new things and eager for feedback.
The greatest fire-starter for the greatness within the others. An awesome tutor, always able to push the others limits while pushing himself.

Paulo Moutinho:
The 'artist'. This game wouldn't be possible without his skills. All the sprites were hand drawn by him (Renata helped, a LOT >_<).
Loves Coding, Cobol enthusiast, easy going, good sense of humour and a good teammate.
Saw a huge improvement in his coding skills during this project (mostly due to seeing how other people solve problems, giving him
some new tools to work with).

Renata Henriques:
The 'jack of all trades'. Did a bit of everything in this project (from organizing the daily tasks, to coding, to drawing, and motivating us)
Reliable, awesome musical tastes, eager to better herself every single day, winning the previous day's battles. She's a really fast learner, and only needs to be told things once, to replicate them again, without any issues.
For someone who had 0 previous experience in the area, really grew after losing her fear of "writing code and breaking stuff".

Overall, a wonderful team, who couldn't have asked to be in better hands ^^

# Why Keep Up?

This game was developed during the COVID pandemic (circa 1 year post the outbreak), and we were really sad that this
got our physical classes cancelled. It was also at the same time that the anti-vaccine movements really started taking place.

With all this in mind, we decided to make a game that encapsulated the whole feeling of "protect yourself", "vaccines are our friends"
and to keep our mood up during these dire times (the vibrant colours, the upbeat music), while beating this game's villain - COVID.
